# Tanzu Excalidraw

A segmented list of Tanzu relevant excalidraw libraries. Allows for dynamically generating a list of the appropriate icons for your context!

```bash
python3 create_lib.py core users
```

Load `lib.excalidrawlib` into your excalidraw and rock on!

Alternatively, you can individually upload the libraries from the `raw` directory, 1 by 1
